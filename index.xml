      <description>For the last three weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as an Outreachy intern with Linux Kernel. Outreachy is an amazing three-month internship programme to get more underrepresented people to work on Free &amp;amp; Open Source Software (FOSS). It was started because of very low participation of women (less than 8%) in Google Summer of Code (GSoC). It&amp;rsquo;s completely remote and interns are paid $5,500 on completion of the project with an additional $500 stipend for attending conferences or meet-ups.</description>

      <description>A review of I, Robot and The Caves of Steel, and the problematic characterisation of women.
 I have a huge problem with Asimov. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing that so many people who have read him are not talking about it. And it is in his characterization of women. That is, if they exist at all. There is one other Asimov I&amp;rsquo;ve read and that&amp;rsquo;s I, Robot. I admit, I enjoyed the short story collection a lot.</description>

      <title>Book Review : The Three Body Problem</title>

      <description>TL;DR, 3.5 out of 5 stars
I really really wanted to like The Three Body Problem a lot more because of the numerous positive reviews I&amp;rsquo;ve been hearing. I thought it was very interesting (Gobbled it up in three days straight!). It was full of great ideas and very imaginative. The parts in which we enter the game simulation were so fun to read. It was unfortunate when the game came abruptly to an end.</description>

      <description>This is my last week at @Flipkart! Thursday- November 30th will be my last day of work, after which I go on a 4-month sabbatical. I will have to return all my IT assets including my beloved MacBook Pro :-(
Back to the Outreachy excitement! There are a lot of things I want to get done before the internship officialy starts on the December 5. I have started to maintain a journal of what I am going to be working on every day.</description>
