	<h1>What have I been doing for Outreachy? <aside><a href="/tags/outreachy/" class="w3-tag">/outreachy</a>&nbsp; </aside></h1>
	<p>This is my last week at <a href="https://flipkart.com">@Flipkart</a>! Thursday- November
30th will be my last day of work, after which I go on a 4-month sabbatical. I
will have to return all my IT assets including my beloved MacBook Pro :-(</p>

<p>Back to the Outreachy excitement! There are a lot of things I want to get done
before the internship officialy starts on the December 5. I have started to
maintain a <a href="https://github.com/aishpant/Journal">journal</a> of what I am going to
be working on every day. (Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/jaseemabid">@jaseemabid</a>
for the inspiration who was in turn inspired by @recursecenter). The idea of the
journaling is to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Celebrate openness? I am going to be working full-time on FOSS (for the very
first time :D), nothing will be proprietary.</li>
<li>Accountability is great.</li>
<li>History is great!</li>
</ol>

<p>Other than this I have a list of TODOs for this week:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Write a blog post about Outreachy selection and/or a project description.
Writing one every two weeks is one of the mandatory parts of the internship.</p></li>

<li><p>Back up data from the office laptop.</p></li>

<li><p>Set up the borrowed laptop with the linux codebase and all my dotfiles.</p></li>

<li><p>Become friends with tmux. Hopefully this third attempt will be my last
attempt.</p></li>

<li><p>Go through the vimtutor tutorial 3 more times. I know my way around vim
pretty good by now and it has made me SO much more productive but it&rsquo;s easy
to forget commands that can save repetetive work. Also build muscle memory.</p></li>

<li><p>Complete set-up of the home office. One of the best parts of the internship
has to be that it&rsquo;s completely remote! I am very happy that I get to avoid
the horrible every day commute to office. It would mean drastically less
exposure to pollution and traffic. Bangalore is kind of notorious for its
traffic situation. Last week I bought a laptop stand, a keyboard, a mouse and
really nice headphones. I am wondering if I should get a bigger study table.
Well, anyway I will figure something out.</p></li>

<li><p>Keep reading The Linux Programming Interface by Michael Kerrisk. He is the
author of almost 70% of the linux manpages! And the maintainer of the
manpages project. Again very happy that I managed to procure a copy. This is
the most complete and thourough book on the linux operating system.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is all for now. I should be back hopefully shortly with the next blog post.</p>
