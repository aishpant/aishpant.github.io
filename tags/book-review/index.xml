      <description>A review of I, Robot and The Caves of Steel, and the problematic characterisation of women.
 I have a huge problem with Asimov. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing that so many people who have read him are not talking about it. And it is in his characterization of women. That is, if they exist at all. There is one other Asimov I&amp;rsquo;ve read and that&amp;rsquo;s I, Robot. I admit, I enjoyed the short story collection a lot.</description>

      <description>TL;DR, 3.5 out of 5 stars
I really really wanted to like The Three Body Problem a lot more because of the numerous positive reviews I&amp;rsquo;ve been hearing. I thought it was very interesting (Gobbled it up in three days straight!). It was full of great ideas and very imaginative. The parts in which we enter the game simulation were so fun to read. It was unfortunate when the game came abruptly to an end.</description>
