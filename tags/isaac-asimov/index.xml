      <description>A review of I, Robot and The Caves of Steel, and the problematic characterisation of women.
 I have a huge problem with Asimov. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing that so many people who have read him are not talking about it. And it is in his characterization of women. That is, if they exist at all. There is one other Asimov I&amp;rsquo;ve read and that&amp;rsquo;s I, Robot. I admit, I enjoyed the short story collection a lot.</description>
