      <description>LKML is a very high volume mailing list. I accumulate around 500 emails during the time I spend sleeping. It&amp;rsquo;s a kitchen sink for every kernel patch and discussion that is going on, which is a good thing and a bad thing. Because I care about only a few of them. Most users subscribe to and read only subsystem specific mailing lists. The trick is to run scripts on top of them to find the emails of interest.</description>
