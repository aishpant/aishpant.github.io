      <description>I have been writing Go for about 6 months now at my new job. Coming from a Java world, it is a joy to write Go. Some may call the language boring, because it is easy to learn and easy to write. This is precisely what I love the most about Go. There usually isn&amp;rsquo;t more than one way of achieving the same result.
If you are able to work through the gotour, I believe you should be able to understand 99% of the open source Go code.</description>
