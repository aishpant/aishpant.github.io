      <description>This is my last week at @Flipkart! Thursday- November 30th will be my last day of work, after which I go on a 4-month sabbatical. I will have to return all my IT assets including my beloved MacBook Pro :-(
Back to the Outreachy excitement! There are a lot of things I want to get done before the internship officialy starts on the December 5. I have started to maintain a journal of what I am going to be working on every day.</description>
