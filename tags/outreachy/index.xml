      <description>For the last three weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as an Outreachy intern with Linux Kernel. Outreachy is an amazing three-month internship programme to get more underrepresented people to work on Free &amp;amp; Open Source Software (FOSS). It was started because of very low participation of women (less than 8%) in Google Summer of Code (GSoC). It&amp;rsquo;s completely remote and interns are paid $5,500 on completion of the project with an additional $500 stipend for attending conferences or meet-ups.</description>
